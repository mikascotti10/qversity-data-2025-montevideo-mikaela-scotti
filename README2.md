# Qversity Data Project â€“ Mikaela Scotti

## Overview

This project implements a complete data pipeline using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) on a custom telecommunications dataset. The pipeline leverages Docker, PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow for orchestration, and dbt for data transformation and modeling.

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion. Data is extracted as-is from a public S3 bucket and stored in PostgreSQL without transformation, ensuring full traceability and auditability.
- **Silver Layer**: [To be completed in the next phase.]
- **Gold Layer**: [To be completed in the next phase.]

**Key insights and business metrics will be described in later stages.**
